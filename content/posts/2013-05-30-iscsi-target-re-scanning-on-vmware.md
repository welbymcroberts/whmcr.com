If youâ€™re using iSCSI on VMWare but have a requirement to rescan the luns after a machine has booted (For example a VM which has DirectPath to a Storage card enabled, which is hosting your iSCSI luns) you can simply do so with the following command

```bash
ssh USER@ESXIHOST-- 'esxcli storage core adapter rescan --all && esxcfg-rescan -A' 1>/dev/null 2>/dev/null
```
